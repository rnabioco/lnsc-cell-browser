  abstract: The detection of foreign antigens in vivo has relied on fluorescent conjugation
    or indirect read-outs such as antigen presentation. In our studies, we found that
    these widely used techniques had several technical limitations that have precluded
    a complete picture of antigen trafficking or retention across lymph node cell
    types. To address these limitations, we developed a 'molecular tracking device'
    to follow the distribution, acquisition, and retention of antigen in the lymph
    node. Utilizing an antigen conjugated to a nuclease-resistant DNA tag, acting
    as a combined antigen-adjuvant conjugate, and single-cell mRNA sequencing, we
    quantified antigen abundance in the lymph node. Variable antigen levels enabled
    the identification of caveolar endocytosis as a mechanism of antigen acquisition
    or retention in lymphatic endothelial cells. Thus, these molecular tracking devices
    enable new approaches to study dynamic tissue dissemination of antigen-adjuvant
    conjugates and identify new mechanisms of antigen acquisition and retention at
    cellular resolution in vivo.

  abstract: Antigens derived from viral infection or vaccination can persist within
    a host for many weeks after resolution of the infection or vaccine responses.
    We previously identified lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) as the repository for
    this antigen archival, yet LECs are unable to present their archived antigens
    to CD8+ T cells, and instead transfer their antigens to CD11c+ antigen-presenting
    cells (APC). Here we show that the exchange of archived antigens between LECs
    and APCs is mediated by migratory dendritic cells (DC). After vaccination, both
    migratory basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BatF3)-dependent
    and BatF3-independent DCs are responsible for antigen exchange and cross-presentation.
    However, exchange of archived viral antigens is mediated only by BatF3-dependent
    migratory DCs potentially acquiring apoptotic LECs. In conclusion, LEC-archived
    antigens are exchanged with migratory DCs, both directly and through LEC apoptosis,
    to cross-present archived antigens to circulating T cells.

  abstract: Viremia in the vertebrate host is a major determinant of arboviral reservoir
    competency, transmission efficiency, and disease severity. However, immune mechanisms
    that control arboviral viremia are poorly defined. Here, we identify critical
    roles for the scavenger receptor MARCO in controlling viremia during arthritogenic
    alphavirus infections in mice. Following subcutaneous inoculation, arthritogenic
    alphavirus particles drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic
    endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN), limiting viral spread
    to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the bloodstream, alphavirus particles are cleared
    from the circulation by MARCO-expressing Kupffer cells in the liver, limiting
    viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO-mediated accumulation of alphavirus
    particles in the draining lymph node and liver is an important host defense mechanism
    as viremia and viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO-/- mice and disease
    is more severe. In contrast to prior studies implicating a key role for lymph
    node macrophages in limiting viral dissemination, these findings exemplify a previously
    unrecognized arbovirus-scavenging role for lymphatic endothelial cells and improve
    our mechanistic understanding of viremia control during arthritogenic alphavirus
    infection.

  title: Trafficking and retention of protein antigens across systems and immune cell
    types

  abstract: In response to infection or vaccination, the immune system initially responds
    non-specifically to the foreign insult (innate) and then develops a specific response
    to the foreign antigen (adaptive). The programming of the immune response is shaped
    by the dispersal and delivery of antigens. The antigen size, innate immune activation
    and location of the insult all determine how antigens are handled. In this review
    we outline which specific cell types are required for antigen trafficking, which
    processes require active compared to passive transport, the ability of specific
    cell types to retain antigens and the viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, influenza
    and Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus) and pattern recognition
    receptor activation that can initiate antigen retention. Both where the protein
    antigen is localized and how long it remains are critically important in shaping
    protective immune responses. Therefore, understanding antigen trafficking and
    retention is necessary to understand the type and magnitude of the immune response
    and essential for the development of novel vaccine and therapeutic targets.

  abstract: Infection with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes disruption of draining
    lymph node (dLN) organization, including paracortical relocalization of B cells,
    loss of the B cell-T cell border, and lymphocyte depletion that is associated
    with infiltration of the LN with inflammatory myeloid cells. Here, we find that
    during the first 24 h of infection, CHIKV RNA accumulates in MARCO-expressing
    lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in both the floor and medullary LN sinuses.
    The accumulation of viral RNA in the LN was associated with a switch to an antiviral
    and inflammatory gene expression program across LN stromal cells, and this inflammatory
    response, including recruitment of myeloid cells to the LN, was accelerated by
    CHIKV-MARCO interactions. As CHIKV infection progressed, both floor and medullary
    LECs diminished in number, suggesting further functional impairment of the LN
    by infection. Consistent with this idea, we find that antigen acquisition by LECs,
    a key function of LN LECs during infection and immunization, was reduced during
    pathogenic CHIKV infection.
