Here, we outline a major role for PD-L1 intracellular signaling in the control of dendritic cell (DC) migration from the skin to the draining lymph node (dLN). Using a mutant mouse model, we identify a TSS signaling motif within the intracellular domain of PD-L1. The TSS motif proves critical for chemokine-mediated DC migration to the dLN during inflammation. This loss of DC migration, in the PD-L1 TSS mutant, leads to a significant decline in T cell priming when DC trafficking is required for antigen delivery to the dLN. Finally, the TSS motif is required for chemokine receptor signaling downstream of the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, ERK phosphorylation, and actin polymerization in DCs."

    "text": "Beth Tamburini, Jeffrey Finlon, Austin Gillen, Michael Kriss, Kent Riemondy, Rui Fu, Ronald Schuyler, Jay Hesselberth, Hugo Rosen, Matthew Burchill\nLiver lymphatic vessels support liver function by draining interstitial fluid, cholesterol, fat, and immune cells for surveillance in the liver draining lymph node. Chronic liver disease is associated with increased inflammation and immune cell infiltrate. However, it is currently unknown if or how lymphatic vessels respond to increased inflammation and immune cell infiltrate in the liver during chronic disease. Here we demonstrate that lymphatic vessel abundance increases in patients with chronic liver disease and is associated with areas of fibrosis and immune cell infiltration. Using single-cell mRNA sequencing and multi-spectral immunofluorescence analysis we identified liver lymphatic endothelial cells and found that chronic liver disease results in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) that are in active cell cycle with increased expression of CCL21. Additionally, we found that LECs from patients with NASH adopt a transcriptional program associated with increased IL13 signaling. Moreover, we found that oxidized low density lipoprotein, associated with NASH pathogenesis, induced the transcription and protein production of IL13 in LECs both in vitro and in a mouse model. Finally, we show that oxidized low density lipoprotein reduced the transcription of PROX1 and decreased lymphatic stability. Together these data indicate that LECs are active participants in the liver, expanding in an attempt to maintain tissue homeostasis. However, when inflammatory signals, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein are increased, as in NASH, lymphatic function declines and liver homeostasis is impeded."

Here, we find that, during the time frame of antigen archiving, LEC apoptosis caused by a second, but unrelated, innate immune stimulus such as vaccina viral infection or CpG DNA administration boosted memory CD8+ T cells specific to the archived antigen. In contrast to “bystander” activation associated with unrelated infections, the memory CD8+ T cells specific to the vaccine archived antigen were significantly higher than memory CD8+ T cells of a different antigen specificity. Finally, the boosted memory CD8+ T cells resulted in increased protection against Listeria monocytogenes expressing the vaccine antigen, but only for the duration that the vaccine antigen was archived. These findings outline a novel mechanism by which LNSC archived antigens, in addition to bystander activation, can augment memory CD8+ T cell responses during repeated inflammatory insults."

    "text": "Mary McCarthy, Bennett Davenport, Glennys Reynoso, Erin Lucas, Nicholas May, Susan Elmore, Beth Tamburini, Heather Hickman, Thomas Morrison\nChikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes acute and chronic rheumatologic disease. Pathogenic CHIKV strains persist in joints of immunocompetent mice, while the attenuated CHIKV strain 181/25 is cleared by adaptive immunity. We analyzed the draining lymph node (dLN) to define events in lymphoid tissue that may contribute to CHIKV persistence or clearance. Acute 181/25 infection resulted in dLN enlargement and germinal center (GC) formation, while the dLN of mice infected with pathogenic CHIKV became highly disorganized and depleted of lymphocytes. Using CHIKV strains encoding ovalbumin-specific TCR epitopes, we found that lymphocyte depletion was not due to impaired lymphocyte proliferation. Instead, the accumulation of naive lymphocytes transferred from the vasculature to the dLN was reduced, which was associated with fewer high endothelial venule cells and decreased CCL21 production. Following NP-OVA immunization, NP-specific GC B cells in the dLN were decreased during pathogenic, but not attenuated, CHIKV infection. Our data suggest that pathogenic, persistent strains of CHIKV disable the development of adaptive immune responses within the dLN."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Erin Lucas, Jeffrey Finlon, Matthew Burchill, Mary McCarthy, Thomas Morrison, Tonya Colpitts, Beth Tamburini\nLymph node (LN) expansion during an immune response is a complex process that involves the relaxation of the fibroblastic network, germinal center formation, and lymphatic vessel growth. These processes require the stromal cell network of the LN to act deliberately to accommodate the influx of immune cells to the LN. The molecular drivers of these processes are not well understood. Therefore, we asked whether the immediate cytokines type 1 IFN produced during viral infection influence the lymphatic network of the LN in mice. We found that following an IFN-inducing stimulus such as viral infection or polyI:C, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is dynamically upregulated on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). We found that reception of type 1 IFN by LECs is important for the upregulation of PD-L1 of mouse and human LECs and the inhibition of LEC expansion in the LN. Expression of PD-L1 by LECs is also important for the regulation of LN expansion and contraction after an IFN-inducing stimulus. We demonstrate a direct role for both type 1 IFN and PD-L1 in inhibiting LEC division and in promoting LEC survival. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism for the coordination of type 1 IFN and PD-L1 in manipulating LEC expansion and survival during an inflammatory immune response."

    "text": "Ju-Sim Kim, Lin Liu, Sashi Kant, David Orlicky, Siva Uppalapati, Alyssa Margolis, Bennett Davenport, Thomas Morrison, Jennifer Matsuda, Michael McClelland, Jessica Jones-Carson, Andres Vazquez-Torres\nIntracellular Salmonella experiencing oxidative stress downregulates aerobic respiration. To maintain cellular energetics during periods of oxidative stress, intracellular Salmonella must utilize terminal electron acceptors of lower energetic value than molecular oxygen. We show here that intracellular Salmonella undergoes anaerobic respiration during adaptation to the respiratory burst of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in macrophages and in mice. Reactive oxygen species generated by phagocytes oxidize methionine, generating methionine sulfoxide. Anaerobic Salmonella uses the molybdenum cofactor-containing DmsABC enzymatic complex to reduce methionine sulfoxide. The enzymatic activity of the methionine sulfoxide reductase DmsABC helps Salmonella maintain an alkaline cytoplasm that supports the synthesis of the antioxidant hydrogen sulfide via cysteine desulfuration while providing a source of methionine and fostering redox balancing by associated dehydrogenases. Our investigations demonstrate that nontyphoidal Salmonella responding to oxidative stress exploits the anaerobic metabolism associated with dmsABC gene products, a pathway that has accrued inactivating mutations in human-adapted typhoidal serovars."

Here we show that antigen can similarly persist for weeks following viral challenge and vaccination. Antigen is captured by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) under conditions that induce LEC proliferation. Consistent with published data showing that viral antigen persistence impacts the function of circulating memory T cells, we find that vaccine-elicited antigen persistence, found on LECs, positively influences the degree of protective immunity provided by circulating memory CD8(+) T cells. The coupling of LEC proliferation and antigen capture identifies a mechanism by which the LECs store, or ‘archive’, antigens for extended periods of time after antigen challenge, thereby increasing IFNγ/IL-2 production and enhancing protection against infection. These findings therefore have the potential to have an impact on future vaccination strategies and our understanding of the role for persisting antigen in both vaccine and infectious settings."

    "text": "Thu Doan, Tadg Forward, Beth Tamburini\nIn response to infection or vaccination, the immune system initially responds non-specifically to the foreign insult (innate) and then develops a specific response to the foreign antigen (adaptive). The programming of the immune response is shaped by the dispersal and delivery of antigens. The antigen size, innate immune activation and location of the insult all determine how antigens are handled. In this review we outline which specific cell types are required for antigen trafficking, which processes require active compared to passive transport, the ability of specific cell types to retain antigens and the viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, influenza and Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus) and pattern recognition receptor activation that can initiate antigen retention. Both where the protein antigen is localized and how long it remains are critically important in shaping protective immune responses. Therefore, understanding antigen trafficking and retention is necessary to understand the type and magnitude of the immune response and essential for the development of novel vaccine and therapeutic targets."

Here, we find that during the first 24 h of infection, CHIKV RNA accumulates in MARCO-expressing lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in both the floor and medullary LN sinuses. The accumulation of viral RNA in the LN was associated with a switch to an antiviral and inflammatory gene expression program across LN stromal cells, and this inflammatory response, including recruitment of myeloid cells to the LN, was accelerated by CHIKV-MARCO interactions. As CHIKV infection progressed, both floor and medullary LECs diminished in number, suggesting further functional impairment of the LN by infection. Consistent with this idea, we find that antigen acquisition by LECs, a key function of LN LECs during infection and immunization, was reduced during pathogenic CHIKV infection."

However, immune mechanisms that control arboviral viremia are poorly defined. Here, we identify critical roles for the scavenger receptor MARCO in controlling viremia during arthritogenic alphavirus infections in mice. Following subcutaneous inoculation, arthritogenic alphavirus particles drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN), limiting viral spread to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the bloodstream, alphavirus particles are cleared from the circulation by MARCO-expressing Kupffer cells in the liver, limiting viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO-mediated accumulation of alphavirus particles in the draining lymph node and liver is an important host defense mechanism as viremia and viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO-/- mice and disease is more severe. In contrast to prior studies implicating a key role for lymph node macrophages in limiting viral dissemination, these findings exemplify a previously unrecognized arbovirus-scavenging role for lymphatic endothelial cells and improve our mechanistic understanding of viremia control during arthritogenic alphavirus infection."

After vaccination, both migratory basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BatF3)-dependent and BatF3-independent DCs are responsible for antigen exchange and cross-presentation. However, exchange of archived viral antigens is mediated only by BatF3-dependent migratory DCs potentially acquiring apoptotic LECs. In conclusion, LEC-archived antigens are exchanged with migratory DCs, both directly and through LEC apoptosis, to cross-present archived antigens to circulating T cells."

We use genetic, molecular, cellular, and immunological approaches to define molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, to elucidate immunological mechanisms that dictate viral clearance, including antibodies and B cells, and to evaluate novel therapeutic interventions. My laboratory has developed mouse models of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV)-induced rheumatic disease that recapitulate important aspects of acute and chronic CHIKV and RRV disease in humans. In addition, we also investigate mechanisms of neurological disease associated with neurotropic viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), West Nile virus, and Zika virus. I also have extensive experience working with human coronaviruses and other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses. Together with my long-term collaborator Dr. Beth Tamburini, I will serve as a principal investigator for this MPI NIH P01 Program Project grant. Additionally, I will serve as the Lead for Core A (Administrative Core) and the Lead for Research Project 1. The primary goals of this collaborative and interdisciplinary program are to test the hypothesis that viral and antigen acquisition by lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) actively shapes immunity by programming both pathogen and vaccine specific responses, and that LNSCs can be manipulated by pathogens and vaccines to guide immune outcomes. Within Research Project 1, we will define mechanistically how discrete LNSCs contribute to the development of antiviral immune responses to infection, regulate viral dissemination to distal sites, and how viral targeting of LNSCs influences the development of immunity to infection and vaccination.\n\nBeth Tamburini, PhD\n\nWebsite Email\nThe overarching goal of my research program is to understand how the lymphatic stroma recognize and react to stimuli within the lymph to guide the immune response. My initial studies of lymphatic stroma were focused on understanding the mechanisms by which lymphatic endothelial cells acquire and retain antigens as well as recruit and interact with immune cells in different organs. Currently my research program is focused on understanding the immunologic consequence of interaction between lymphatic stroma and components of the immune system within different organ systems. We have been working to dissect how the lymphatics respond to stimuli such as proteins, small molecules, fat, cholesterol, alcohol, infectious material and cytokine. We have experience with a number of techniques including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, live molecular imaging, and a number of therapeutic treatments to target and identify lymphatic endothelial cells as well as experience in several mouse models and assays. In addition, my expertise and the expertise of a wide range of collaborators at the University of Colorado in the fields of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Immunology have been critical in developing this research program. This collaborative research program as proven to be well suited for the training and success of the graduate students and post-docs in my laboratory.\n\nJenna Guthmiller, PhD\n\nPublications Website Email\nMy long-term scientific goals are to understand the complex interactions between pathogens and the immune response mounted against them, with the objective of identifying and developing interventions to limit global infectious disease burdens. Fitting within these goals, my independent laboratory studies how preexisting immunity influences future immune responses against rapidly evolving viruses. My major contributions to science are understanding how protective humoral immunity is generated following infection and vaccination and how vaccination can harness broadly protective humoral immunity. During my postdoctoral studies, I investigated how preexisting immunity against influenza viruses shapes the recall of memory B cells in humans. I found that in the absence of preexisting immunity against the variable epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain, humans could recall memory B cells against broadly protective epitopes of HA. These studies identified several novel classes of broadly neutralizing antibodies and a new highly conserved epitope where HA ‘anchors’ itself into the viral membrane. My research also identified that the first in-human universal influenza vaccine, which is intended to circumvent preexisting antibodies, robustly induced antibodies against broadly protective epitopes, including the anchor epitope. Lastly, I identified influenza vaccination and infection in humans differentially recalled discrete memory B cell specificities, with infection recalling memory B cells primed during childhood against highly conserved, albeit non-protective antigens. Together, these studies highlight the importance of understanding how preexisting antibodies influence the generation of broadly protective immunity.\n\nJay Hesselberth, PhD\n\nPublications Website Email\nI am an RNA biochemist and computational biologist with extensive experience in developing new high- throughput methods and associated bioinformatic analysis software. My RNA biology program spans classical and modern approaches to address outstanding questions in RNA damage and repair. Over the past ten years my group has developed new sequencing approaches to identify damaged RNAs and new model systems with which to understand the causes and consequences of RNA damage. Our studies have led to new concepts in post-transcriptional regulation that have broad implications for understanding the role of RNA damage in biology. Recently we have been focused on understanding how RNA damage and repair events are coupled to control RNA fate after stress-induced RNA cleavage (Ancar et al. and Cherry et al.). More recently, we have applied nanopore RNA sequencing to characterize the landscape of RNA repair events in budding yeast.\n\nJennifer Matsuda, PhD\n\nPublications Email\nIn 2008, following my graduate studies and post-doctoral training, I became the Director of the Mouse Genetics Core Facility at National Jewish Health. Given my years at the bench, it was critical to me that the facility I established enabled all investigators, regardless of prior experience, with the support necessary to make mouse models. To this end, in addition to classic services like ES cell targeting, blastocyst and pronuclear microinjections, embryo and sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, and rederivation, we have developed additional areas of expertise. We generate complex DNA constructs, using BAC recombineering, markerless recombineering, and classic cloning methodologies. We also train graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in our laboratory to make their own constructs. We have also gained the expertise to identify homologous recombinant ES cell clones by Loss of Allele (LOA). In addition, we successfully use engineered nucleases (ZFNs, TALENs, and more recently CRISPR/Cas9) to generate knockout mice by NHEJ as well as relying upon homology directed repair (HDR) to introduce genetic modifications. This technology has been further improved upon by our capacity to make mouse models directly on a variety of backgrounds by using IVF, including but not limited to: C57BL/6, FVB, NOD, 129S4, and NSGS backgrounds as well genetically modified strains of mice. Due to the core’s consistently high quality of work, we have recently been designated as the Regional Mouse Genetics Core Facility to support investigators at the University of Colorado Denver, in addition to the investigators at NJH."
