    "text": "Kathryn Carpentier, Ryan Sheridan, Cormac Lucas, Bennett Davenport, Frances Li, Erin Lucas, Mary McCarthy, Glennys Reynoso, Nicholas May, Beth Tamburini, Jay Hesselberth, Heather Hickman, Thomas Morrison\nViremia in the vertebrate host is a major determinant of arboviral reservoir competency, transmission efficiency, and disease severity. However, immune mechanisms that control arboviral viremia are poorly defined. Here, we identify critical roles for the scavenger receptor MARCO in controlling viremia during arthritogenic alphavirus infections in mice. Following subcutaneous inoculation, arthritogenic alphavirus particles drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN), limiting viral spread to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the bloodstream, alphavirus particles are cleared from the circulation by MARCO-expressing Kupffer cells in the liver, limiting viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO-mediated accumulation of alphavirus particles in the draining lymph node and liver is an important host defense mechanism as viremia and viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO-/- mice and disease is more severe. In contrast to prior studies implicating a key role for lymph node macrophages in limiting viral dissemination, these findings exemplify a previously unrecognized arbovirus-scavenging role for lymphatic endothelial cells and improve our mechanistic understanding of viremia control during arthritogenic alphavirus infection."

    "text": "Frances Li, Kathryn Carpentier, David Hawman, Cormac Lucas, Stephanie Ander, Heinz Feldmann, Thomas Morrison\nArboviruses are public health threats that cause explosive outbreaks. Major determinants of arbovirus transmission, geographic spread, and pathogenesis are the magnitude and duration of viremia in vertebrate hosts. Previously, we determined that multiple alphaviruses are cleared efficiently from murine circulation by the scavenger receptor MARCO (Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure). Here, we define biochemical features on chikungunya (CHIKV), o’nyong ’nyong (ONNV), and Ross River (RRV) viruses required for MARCO-dependent clearance in vivo. In vitro, MARCO expression promotes binding and internalization of CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV via the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain. Furthermore, we observe species-specific effects of the MARCO SRCR domain on CHIKV internalization, where those from known amplification hosts fail to promote CHIKV internalization. Consistent with this observation, CHIKV is inefficiently cleared from the circulation of rhesus macaques in contrast with mice. These findings suggest a role for MARCO in determining whether a vertebrate serves as an amplification or dead-end host following CHIKV infection."

    "text": "Thu Doan, Tadg Forward, Beth Tamburini\nIn response to infection or vaccination, the immune system initially responds non-specifically to the foreign insult (innate) and then develops a specific response to the foreign antigen (adaptive). The programming of the immune response is shaped by the dispersal and delivery of antigens. The antigen size, innate immune activation and location of the insult all determine how antigens are handled. In this review we outline which specific cell types are required for antigen trafficking, which processes require active compared to passive transport, the ability of specific cell types to retain antigens and the viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, influenza and Sendai virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus) and pattern recognition receptor activation that can initiate antigen retention. Both where the protein antigen is localized and how long it remains are critically important in shaping protective immune responses. Therefore, understanding antigen trafficking and retention is necessary to understand the type and magnitude of the immune response and essential for the development of novel vaccine and therapeutic targets."

    "text": "Cormac Lucas, Ryan Sheridan, Glennys Reynoso, Bennett Davenport, Mary McCarthy, Aspen Martin, Jay Hesselberth, Heather Hickman, Beth Tamburini, Thomas Morrison\nInfection with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes disruption of draining lymph node (dLN) organization, including paracortical relocalization of B cells, loss of the B cell-T cell border, and lymphocyte depletion that is associated with infiltration of the LN with inflammatory myeloid cells. Here, we find that during the first 24 h of infection, CHIKV RNA accumulates in MARCO-expressing lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in both the floor and medullary LN sinuses. The accumulation of viral RNA in the LN was associated with a switch to an antiviral and inflammatory gene expression program across LN stromal cells, and this inflammatory response, including recruitment of myeloid cells to the LN, was accelerated by CHIKV-MARCO interactions. As CHIKV infection progressed, both floor and medullary LECs diminished in number, suggesting further functional impairment of the LN by infection. Consistent with this idea, we find that antigen acquisition by LECs, a key function of LN LECs during infection and immunization, was reduced during pathogenic CHIKV infection."

    "text": "Ross Kedl, Robin Lindsay, Jeffrey Finlon, Erin Lucas, Rachel Friedman, Beth Tamburini\nAntigens derived from viral infection or vaccination can persist within a host for many weeks after resolution of the infection or vaccine responses. We previously identified lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) as the repository for this antigen archival, yet LECs are unable to present their archived antigens to CD8+ T cells, and instead transfer their antigens to CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells (APC). Here we show that the exchange of archived antigens between LECs and APCs is mediated by migratory dendritic cells (DC). After vaccination, both migratory basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BatF3)-dependent and BatF3-independent DCs are responsible for antigen exchange and cross-presentation. However, exchange of archived viral antigens is mediated only by BatF3-dependent migratory DCs potentially acquiring apoptotic LECs. In conclusion, LEC-archived antigens are exchanged with migratory DCs, both directly and through LEC apoptosis, to cross-present archived antigens to circulating T cells."

Fitting within these goals, my independent laboratory studies how preexisting immunity influences future immune responses against rapidly evolving viruses. My major contributions to science are understanding how protective humoral immunity is generated following infection and vaccination and how vaccination can harness broadly protective humoral immunity. During my postdoctoral studies, I investigated how preexisting immunity against influenza viruses shapes the recall of memory B cells in humans. I found that in the absence of preexisting immunity against the variable epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain, humans could recall memory B cells against broadly protective epitopes of HA. These studies identified several novel classes of broadly neutralizing antibodies and a new highly conserved epitope where HA ‘anchors’ itself into the viral membrane. My research also identified that the first in-human universal influenza vaccine, which is intended to circumvent preexisting antibodies, robustly induced antibodies against broadly protective epitopes, including the anchor epitope. Lastly, I identified influenza vaccination and infection in humans differentially recalled discrete memory B cell specificities, with infection recalling memory B cells primed during childhood against highly conserved, albeit non-protective antigens. Together, these studies highlight the importance of understanding how preexisting antibodies influence the generation of broadly protective immunity."
