However, immune mechanisms that control arboviral viremia are poorly defined. Here, we identify critical roles for the scavenger receptor MARCO in controlling viremia during arthritogenic alphavirus infections in mice. Following subcutaneous inoculation, arthritogenic alphavirus particles drain via the lymph and are rapidly captured by MARCO+ lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in the draining lymph node (dLN), limiting viral spread to the bloodstream. Upon reaching the bloodstream, alphavirus particles are cleared from the circulation by MARCO‐expressing Kupffer cells in the liver, limiting viremia and further viral dissemination. MARCO‐mediated accumulation of alphavirus particles in the draining lymph node and liver is an important host defense mechanism as viremia and viral tissue burdens are elevated in MARCO−/− mice and disease is more severe. In contrast to prior studies implicating a key role for lymph node macrophages in limiting viral dissemination, these findings exemplify a previously unrecognized arbovirus‐scavenging role for lymphatic endothelial cells and improve our mechanistic understanding of viremia control during arthritogenic alphavirus infection."

    "text": "Beth A Jirón Tamburini, Matthew A Burchill, Ross M Kedl\nAntigen derived from viral infections with influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus can persist after resolution of infection. Here we show that antigen can similarly persist for weeks following viral challenge and vaccination. Antigen is captured by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) under conditions that induce LEC proliferation. Consistent with published data showing that viral antigen persistence impacts the function of circulating memory T cells, we find that vaccine-elicited antigen persistence, found on LECs, positively influences the degree of protective immunity provided by circulating memory CD8+ T cells. The coupling of LEC proliferation and antigen capture identifies a mechanism by which the LECs store, or ‘archive’, antigens for extended periods of time after antigen challenge, thereby increasing IFNγ/IL-2 production and enhancing protection against infection. These findings therefore have the potential to have an impact on future vaccination strategies and our understanding of the role for persisting antigen in both vaccine and infectious settings."

LNSCs are comprised of diverse populations of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. LNSCs coordinate lymphocyte entry into the lymph node (LN), facilitate lymphocyte trafficking into distinct LN niches, regulate lymphocyte survival, and promote LN expansion. Our overall hypothesis is that viral and antigen acquisition by LNSCs shapes immunity by programming pathogen and vaccine specific responses, and that LNSCs can be manipulated by pathogens and vaccines to guide immune outcomes."

We previously identified lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) as the repository for this antigen archival, yet LECs are unable to present their archived antigens to CD8+ T cells, and instead transfer their antigens to CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells (APC). Here we show that the exchange of archived antigens between LECs and APCs is mediated by migratory dendritic cells (DC). After vaccination, both migratory basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BatF3)-dependent and BatF3-independent DCs are responsible for antigen exchange and cross-presentation. However, exchange of archived viral antigens is mediated only by BatF3-dependent migratory DCs potentially acquiring apoptotic LECs. In conclusion, LEC-archived antigens are exchanged with migratory DCs, both directly and through LEC apoptosis, to cross-present archived antigens to circulating T cells."

My initial studies of lymphatic stroma were focused on understanding the mechanisms by which lymphatic endothelial cells acquire and retain antigens as well as recruit and interact with immune cells in different organs. Currently my research program is focused on understanding the immunologic consequence of interaction between lymphatic stroma and components of the immune system within different organ systems. We have been working to dissect how the lymphatics respond to stimuli such as proteins, small molecules, fat, cholesterol, alcohol, infectious material and cytokine. We have experience with a number of techniques including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, live molecular imaging, and a number of therapeutic treatments to target and identify lymphatic endothelial cells as well as experience in several mouse models and assays. In addition, my expertise and the expertise of a wide range of collaborators at the University of Colorado in the fields of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Immunology have been critical in developing this research program.

Personal Statement My long-term scientific goals are to understand the complex interactions between pathogens and the immune response mounted against them, with the objective of identifying and developing interventions to limit global infectious disease burdens. Fitting within these goals, my independent laboratory studies how preexisting immunity influences future immune responses against rapidly evolving viruses. My major contributions to science are understanding how protective humoral immunity is generated following infection and vaccination and how vaccination can harness broadly protective humoral immunity. During my postdoctoral studies, I investigated how preexisting immunity against influenza viruses shapes the recall of memory B cells in humans. I found that in the absence of preexisting immunity against the variable epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain, humans could recall memory B cells against broadly protective epitopes of HA. These studies identified several novel classes of broadly neutralizing antibodies and a new highly conserved epitope where HA “anchors” itself into the viral membrane. My research also identified that the first in-human universal influenza vaccine, which is intended to circumvent preexisting antibodies, robustly induced antibodies against broadly protective epitopes, including the anchor epitope. Lastly, I identified influenza vaccination and infection in humans differentially recalled discrete memory B cell specificities, with infection recalling memory B cells primed during childhood against highly conserved, albeit non-protective antigens. Together, these studies highlight the importance of understanding how preexisting antibodies influence the generation of broadly protective immunity."

Given my years at the bench, it was critical to me that the facility I established enabled all investigators, regardless of prior experience, with the support necessary to make mouse models. To this end, in addition to classic services like ES cell targeting, blastocyst and pronuclear microinjections, embryo and sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, and rederivation, we have developed additional areas of expertise. We generate complex DNA constructs, using BAC recombineering, markerless recombineering, and classic cloning methodologies. We also train graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in our laboratory to make their own constructs. We have also gained the expertise to identify homologous recombinant ES cell clones by Loss of Allele (LOA). In addition, we successfully use engineered nucleases (ZFNs, TALENs, and more recently CRISPR/Cas9) to generate knockout mice by NHEJ as well as relying upon homology directed repair (HDR) to introduce genetic modifications. This technology has been further improved upon by our capacity to make mouse models directly on a variety of backgrounds by using IVF, including but not limited to: C57BL/6, FVB, NOD, 129S4, and NSGS backgrounds as well genetically modified strains of mice. Due to the core’s consistently high quality of work, we have recently been designated as the Regional Mouse Genetics Core Facility to support investigators at the University of Colorado Denver, in addition to the investigators at NJH."
