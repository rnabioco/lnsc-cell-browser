Lymph node stromal cells (LNSC)s are an understudied and untapped source of
immunomodulatory control. LNSCs are comprised of diverse populations of
fibroblasts and endothelial cells. LNSCs coordinate lymphocyte entry into the
lymph node (LN), facilitate lymphocyte trafficking into distinct LN niches,
regulate lymphocyte survival, and promote LN expansion.
The goal of this program is to investigate how viral and antigen acquisition by
LNSCs shape immunity and how LNSCs can be manipulated by pathogens and vaccines
to guide immune outcomes. This program is composed of three projects
that will investigate distinct aspects of LNSC biology along with three
supporting cores.
