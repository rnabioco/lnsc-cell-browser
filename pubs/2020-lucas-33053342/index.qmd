Although the function of the extracellular region of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) through its interactions with PD-1 on T cells is well studied, little is understood regarding the intracellular domain of PD-L1. Here, we outline a major role for PD-L1 intracellular signaling in the control of dendritic cell (DC) migration from the skin to the draining lymph node (dLN). Using a mutant mouse model, we identify a TSS signaling motif within the intracellular domain of PD-L1. The TSS motif proves critical for chemokine-mediated DC migration to the dLN during inflammation. This loss of DC migration, in the PD-L1 TSS mutant, leads to a significant decline in T cell priming when DC trafficking is required for antigen delivery to the dLN. Finally, the TSS motif is required for chemokine receptor signaling downstream of the GÎ± subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, ERK phosphorylation, and actin polymerization in DCs.
