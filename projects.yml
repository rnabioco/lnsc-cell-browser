project-1:
  title: Define protective and pathogenic roles of LNSCs during viral infection
  short: Project 1 will define how viral targeting of distinct LNSCs regulates
    viral dissemination, LN organization and inflammation, and development of
    adaptive immunity
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that inflammatory responses, cell trafficking, and
    development of protective adaptive immune responses are regulated by
    discrete populations of LNSCs during viral infection
  image: /images/project-1.png
  abstract: Project 1 will define how viral targeting of distinct LNSCs
    regulates viral dissemination, LN organization and inflammation, and
    development of adaptive immunity. Project 1 and Project 2 will establish
    how viral targeting of LNSCs impacts antigen archiving and immune memory to
    archived antigens. Finally, Project 1 coordinates with Project 3 to study
    how isotype-specific immune complexes (ICs) promote chronic viral infection
    of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).
    This project will use novel mouse models and human tissues and advanced
    spatial and single-cell RNA approaches. This project will define how LNSCs
    shape antiviral immune responses and how viruses manipulate LNSCs to evade
    immunity.

project-2:
  title: Identify mechanisms of vaccine antigen localization and retention by
    LNSCs that drive and enhance cellular and humoral immunity
  short: Project 2 will define mechanisms of vaccine antigen acquisition and
    retention by different LNSCs
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that LNSC targeting improves and extends the
    cellular and humoral responses required for vaccine mediated immunity
  image: /images/project-2.png
  abstract: Project 2 will work with Project 3 to define mechanisms of vaccine
    antigen acquisition and retention by different LNSCs. Project 2 will work
    with Projects 1 and 3 to determine if manipulation of antigen duration in
    LNSCs improves vaccine protection against arboviruses and influenza virus.
    Finally, Project 2 will work with Project 1 to define the consequences of
    virus induced cell death on LEC "training" and the impact on vaccine
    immunity.
    This project will distinguish functions of specific LNSC populations and
    create novel vaccine strategies (e.g., mRNA, virus-like particles, and
    lipid nanoparticles) and apply sophisticated spatial and single-cell
    transcriptomic approaches to evaluate antigen levels within infrequent and
    transcriptionally defined LNSC subsets. This project will determine how
    specific LNSC subsets shape vaccine immunity and the consequences of viral
    infection of LNSCs to vaccine immunity.

project-3:
  title: Investigate the role of immune complexes in antigen acquisition and
    retention by LNSCs to modulate cellular and humoral immunity
  short: Project 3 will use stabilized DNA conjugates to track antibody:antigen
    complexes to determine the spatial and cellular localization of immune
    complexes
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that antibody isotype in an IC regulates protective
    immunity by determining which LNSC populations acquire and retain antigen
    via isotype-specific interactions with complement and Fc receptors (FcRs)
  image: /images/project-3.png
  abstract: Project 3 will engineer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with fixed
    antigen specificity on discrete antibody isotypes and subclasses. Using
    stabilized DNA conjugates, Projects 2 and 3 will track antibody:antigen
    complexes to determine the spatial and cellular localization of ICs in
    comparison with free antigen. Project 3 also investigates how FcR expression
    by LNSCs impacts IC acquisition and will work with Project 1 to determine
    viral antigen retention and define consequences to protective humoral and
    cellular immunity. This project will use mouse models engineered to
    manipulate complement receptor and FcR expression by discrete LNSC
    populations and will define how different LNSC populations use antibody to
    determine antigen uptake and localization.
