project-1:
  title: Define protective and pathogenic roles of LNSCs during viral infection
  short: Project 1 will define how viral targeting of distinct LNSCs regulates viral dissemination, LN organization and inflammation, and development of adaptive immunity
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that inflammatory responses, cell trafficking, and development of protective adaptive immune responses are regulated by discrete populations of LNSCs during viral infection
  abstract: Project 1 will define how viral targeting of distinct LNSCs regulates viral dissemination, LN organization and inflammation, and development of adaptive immunity. Project 1 and Project 2 will establish how viral targeting of LNSCs impacts antigen archiving and immune memory to archived antigens. Finally, Project 1 coordinates with Project 3 to study how isotype-specific immune complexes (ICs) promote chronic viral infection of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). This Aim will use novel mouse models and human tissues and advanced spatial and single-cell RNA approaches. This Aim addresses the Program hypothesis by defining how LNSCs shape antiviral immune responses and how viruses manipulate LNSCs to evade immunity.

project-2:
  title: Identify mechanisms of vaccine antigen localization and retention by LNSCs that drive and enhance cellular and humoral immunity
  short: Project 2 will define mechanisms of vaccine antigen acquisition and retention by different LNSCs
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that LNSC targeting improves and extends the cellular and humoral responses required for vaccine mediated immunity
  abstract: Project 2 will work with Project 3 to define mechanisms of vaccine antigen acquisition and retention by different LNSCs. Project 2 will work with Projects 1 and 3 to determine if manipulation of antigen duration in LNSCs improves vaccine protection against arboviruses and influenza virus. Finally, Project 2 will work with Project 1 to define the consequences of virus induced cell death on LEC "training" and the impact on vaccine immunity. This Aim will distinguish functions of specific LNSC populations and create novel vaccine strategies (e.g., mRNA, virus-like particles, and lipid nanoparticles) and apply sophisticated spatial and single-cell transcriptomic approaches to evaluate antigen levels within infrequent and transcriptionally defined LNSC subsets. This Aim addresses the Program hypothesis by determining how specific LNSC subsets shape vaccine immunity and the consequences of viral infection of LNSCs to vaccine immunity.

project-3:
  title: Investigate the role of immune complexes in antigen acquisition and retention by LNSCs to modulate cellular and humoral immunity
  short: Project 3 will use stabilized DNA conjugates to track antibody:antigen complexes to determine the spatial and cellular localization of immune complexes
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that antibody isotype in an IC regulates protective immunity by determining which LNSC populations acquire and retain antigen via isotype-specific interactions with complement and Fc receptors (FcRs)
  abstract: Project 3 will engineer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with fixed antigen specificity on discrete antibody isotypes and subclasses. Using stabilized DNA conjugates, Projects 2 and 3 will track antibody:antigen complexes to determine the spatial and cellular localization of ICs in comparison with free antigen. Project 3 also investigates how FcR expression by LNSCs impacts IC acquisition and will work with Project 1 to determine viral antigen retention and define consequences to protective humoral and cellular immunity. This project uses mouse models engineered to manipulate complement receptor and FcR expression by discrete LNSC populations (Core B) and addresses the Program hypothesis by defining how different LNSC populations use antibody to determine antigen uptake and localization.
