project-1:
  title: Define protective and pathogenic roles of LNSCs during viral infection
  short: "Project 1 will define how viral targeting of distinct LNSCs regulates
    viral dissemination, LN organization and inflammation, and development of
    adaptive immunity"
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that inflammatory responses, cell trafficking, and
    development of protective adaptive immune responses are regulated by
    discrete populations of LNSCs during viral infection

  abstract: "Project 1 will define how viral targeting of distinct LNSCs
    regulates viral dissemination, LN organization and inflammation, and
    development of adaptive immunity. Project 1 will establish
    how viral targeting of LNSCs impacts antigen archiving and immune memory to
    archived antigens. Finally, Project 1 will study
    how isotype-specific immune complexes (ICs) promote chronic viral infection
    of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).
    This project will use novel mouse models and human tissues and advanced
    spatial and single-cell RNA approaches. This project will define how LNSCs
    shape antiviral immune responses and how viruses manipulate LNSCs to evade
    immunity."

project-2:
  title: Identify mechanisms of vaccine antigen localization and retention by
    LNSCs that drive and enhance cellular and humoral immunity
  short: "Project 2 will define mechanisms of vaccine antigen acquisition and
    retention by different LNSCs"
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that LNSC targeting improves and extends the
    cellular and humoral responses required for vaccine mediated immunity
  image: /images/project-2.png
  abstract: "Project 2 will define mechanisms of vaccine
    antigen acquisition and retention by different LNSCs. Project 2 will
    determine if manipulation of antigen duration in
    LNSCs improves vaccine protection against arboviruses and influenza virus.
    Finally, Project 2 will define the consequences of
    virus induced cell death on LEC 'training' and the impact on vaccine
    immunity.
    This project will distinguish functions of specific LNSC populations and
    create novel vaccine strategies (e.g., mRNA, virus-like particles, and
    lipid nanoparticles) and apply sophisticated spatial and single-cell
    transcriptomic approaches to evaluate antigen levels within infrequent and
    transcriptionally defined LNSC subsets. This project will determine how
    specific LNSC subsets shape vaccine immunity and the consequences of viral
    infection of LNSCs to vaccine immunity."

project-3:
  title: Cell and molecular mechanisms of antigen archiving by lymphatic
    endothelial cells
  short: "Project 3 will define cellular and molecular mechanisms promoting
    stable retention of protein and RNA in LECs"
  hypothesis: We hypothesize that antigen archiving is achieved by stable
    compartmentalization of acquired material in endosomes.
  image: /images/project-3.png
  abstract: "Project 3 will define cellular and molecular mechanisms promoting
    stable retention of protein and RNA in LECs. Project 3 will determine how
    LECs stably retain ntigens and how this process is regulated by
    compartmentalization in endosomes. 
    This project will develop and use innovative probes of cellular localization in vivo,
    to evaluate antigen levels within LECs and immune cells."

    mouse models and develop a tissue and cell repository"
  abstract: "Core B will generate
    novel genetic mouse models and develop a tissue and cell repository, this
    includes the following tasks.\n\n
    **Task 1.** Generation of novel mouse lines\n\n
    **Task 2.** Provide a mouse colony for LNSC biology\n\n
    **Task 3.** Provide a resource for maintenance and distribution of human and

core-c:
  title: Molecular technologies and informatics
  short: "Core C will develop and apply new molecular tools and bioinformatic
    approaches to probe LNSC and immune cell biology"
  abstract: "Core C will apply new molecular tools and bioinformatic approaches
    to understand the contributions of lymph node stromal cells to immune
    responses, this includes the following tasks.\n\n
    **Task 1.** Generate and supply validated reagents for single-cell and
    spatial transcriptomic experiments to evaluate LNSC contributions to
    immunity and infection\n\n
    **Task 2.** Provide a bioinformatics resource for rigorous and reproducible
    analysis of sequencing experiments\n\n

    and spatial transcriptomic data"
