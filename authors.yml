  bio: My laboratory investigates mechanisms of infectious disease pathogenesis and
    immunity. We use genetic, molecular, cellular, and immunological approaches to
    define molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, to elucidate immunological mechanisms
    that dictate viral clearance, including antibodies and B cells, and to evaluate
    novel therapeutic interventions. My laboratory has developed mouse models of chikungunya
    virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV)-induced rheumatic disease that recapitulate
    important aspects of acute and chronic CHIKV and RRV disease in humans. In addition,
    we also investigate mechanisms of neurological disease associated with neurotropic
    viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), West Nile virus,
    and Zika virus. I also have extensive experience working with human coronaviruses
    and other highly pathogenic respiratory viruses.

  bio: The overarching goal of my research program is to understand how the lymphatic
    stroma recognize and react to stimuli within the lymph to guide the immune response.
    My initial studies of lymphatic stroma were focused on understanding the mechanisms
    by which lymphatic endothelial cells acquire and retain antigens as well as recruit
    and interact with immune cells in different organs. Currently my research program
    is focused on understanding the immunologic consequence of interaction between
    lymphatic stroma and components of the immune system within different organ systems.
    We have been working to dissect how the lymphatics respond to stimuli such as
    proteins, small molecules, fat, cholesterol, alcohol, infectious material and
    cytokine. We have experience with a number of techniques including flow cytometry,
    immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, live molecular imaging, and a number
    of therapeutic treatments to target and identify lymphatic endothelial cells as
    well as experience in several mouse models and assays. In addition, my expertise
    and the expertise of a wide range of collaborators at the University of Colorado
    in the fields of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Immunology have been critical
    in developing this research program. This collaborative research program as proven
    to be well suited for the training and success of the graduate students and post-docs
    in my laboratory.

  bio: I am an RNA biochemist and computational biologist with extensive experience
    in developing new high- throughput methods and associated bioinformatic analysis
    software. My RNA biology program spans classical and modern approaches to address
    outstanding questions in RNA damage and repair. Over the past ten years my group
    has developed new sequencing approaches to identify damaged RNAs and new model
    systems with which to understand the causes and consequences of RNA damage. Our
    studies have led to new concepts in post-transcriptional regulation that have
    broad implications for understanding the role of RNA damage in biology. Recently
    we have been focused on understanding how RNA damage and repair events are coupled
    to control RNA fate after stress-induced RNA cleavage.
    More recently, we have applied nanopore RNA sequencing to characterize
    the landscape of RNA repair events in budding yeast.

  bio: 'In 2008, following my graduate studies and post-doctoral training, I became
    the Director of the Mouse Genetics Core Facility at National Jewish Health. Given
    my years at the bench, it was critical to me that the facility I established enabled
    all investigators, regardless of prior experience, with the support necessary
    to make mouse models. To this end, in addition to classic services like ES cell
    targeting, blastocyst and pronuclear microinjections, embryo and sperm cryopreservation,
    in vitro fertilization, and rederivation, we have developed additional areas of
    expertise. We generate complex DNA constructs, using BAC recombineering, markerless
    recombineering, and classic cloning methodologies. We also train graduate students
    and post-doctoral fellows in our laboratory to make their own constructs. We have
    also gained the expertise to identify homologous recombinant ES cell clones by
    Loss of Allele (LOA). In addition, we successfully use engineered nucleases (ZFNs,
    TALENs, and more recently CRISPR/Cas9) to generate knockout mice by NHEJ as well
    as relying upon homology directed repair (HDR) to introduce genetic modifications.
    This technology has been further improved upon by our capacity to make mouse models
    directly on a variety of backgrounds by using IVF, including but not limited to:
    C57BL/6, FVB, NOD, 129S4, and NSGS backgrounds as well genetically modified strains
    of mice. Due to the core''s consistently high quality of work, we have recently
    been designated as the Regional Mouse Genetics Core Facility to support investigators
    at the University of Colorado Denver, in addition to the investigators at NJH.'
